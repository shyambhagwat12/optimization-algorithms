# Complexity theory/Oracle lowerbounds of Algs

**Why lower bounds:**
Can i do better based on below:

1. the function class trying to optimize over (convex? strongly convex?)
2. the geometry of the set being optimizing over (cube? sphere? simplex?)
3. the kind of information you have access to (function values? gradients?)
4. the kind of noise model for that information (noiseless/deterministic? stochastic?),
